Reorient
========

An application to periodically ask you a question that requires a response. Helpful to pull you back into reality when computers pull you in.

Every 30 minutes, you will be asked a question. The questions are intended to bring about awareness to yourself by briefly interrupting what you're doing, and making you focus on your emotions.

Your responses are saved to %USERPROFILE%\Documents. The file names are `Responses_MMMM-dd-yyyy.txt`.
For example, `Responses_July-10-2014.txt`.

Each response is saved with the timestamps for when the question was both asked and answered, the question asked, and your response.

As an addition to make it harder to ignore answering a question, your work station will be locked after 5 minutes of non-activity in the response text box. This timer resets while you are typing or after you have unlocked your workstation. Saving your response will stop the timer.
