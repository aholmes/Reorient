Reorient
========

An application to periodically ask you a question that requires a response. Helpful to pull you back into reality when computers pull you in.

Every 30 minutes, you will be asked a question. The questions are intended to bring about awareness to yourself by briefly interrupting what you're doing, and making you focus on your emotions.

Your responses are saved to %USERPROFILE%\Documents. The file names are `Responses_MMMM-dd-yyyy.txt`,
for example, `Responses_July-10-2014.txt`.

Each response is saved with the timestamps for when the question was both asked and answered, the question asked, and your response.

As an addition to make it harder to ignore answering a question, your work station will be locked after 5 minutes of inactivity in the response text box. This timer resets while you are typing or after you have unlocked your workstation. Saving your response will stop the timer.

You've got questions, I've got answers.

#### Is it running!?
Reorient starts by asking you a question, and then sits silently in the background. Every 30 minutes (starting from your last answer), a new question will be asked.

If you have stopped the application, logged out, rebooted, etc. you will need to restart the application.

#### Why did you make this, and why should I use it?
I often lose track of reality and time. I am changing parts of my life to be less oriented around computers, but computers are still a core part of my life, career, and possibly personality. This application will hopefully bring awareness to myself so I stop staying up late, stressing over minor things, remember to eat, and so on. Think of it as "remember, you're a human" software.

If you think small introspection throughout your day will help you out, you might also find this useful.

#### Does it actually help?
I don't know. I just wrote it, and have only just started using it. If you find it helpful, let me know.

#### Can I make it better?
Yes, absolutely. I won't object to pull requests as long as they are in line with improving the code, or further elliminating disassociation when using a computer.
